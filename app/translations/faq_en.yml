    ## **FAQ**

    **How to post questions?**
    Anyone can see the questions and answers posted by community members, but for posting a question or answering one, you need to register first. All we want from you is a valid email address, a password, and a username.

    **What is upvote and how to use it**

    If you find a question or answer interesting and you think that it adds value to the conversation, you can signal your interest or approval by upvoting it. You can upvote questions and answers separately. Answers that get the most votes appear first. Upvote is always a somewhat subjective category, but here are our recommendations:

    Upvote a question if you feel it is particularly useful, for example because you have also encountered a similar issue. You can also praise a question for identifying a problem very clearly.

    Upvote an answer if you think it provides a useful explanation for the question. We suggest upvoting answers that have one or more of the following qualities:

    Precise
    Detailed
    Educative
    Well-written

    **How to ask a good question?**

    Search first - it is possible that someone else has already encountered the same or similar problem
    Summarize your issue in one sentence in the title. Include keywords that differentiate your question from similar ones on the site.
    Use the Description for details
    Give context to your question: it might be useful if you explain how you encountered the problem you’re trying to solve and what prevented you from solving it
    Include code if necessary
    Include all relevant tags
    Proofread before posting
